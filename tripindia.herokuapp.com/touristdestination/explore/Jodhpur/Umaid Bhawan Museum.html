            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur Rajasthan is a brilliant example of remarkable constructions. Moreover, now it’s a five star luxurious hotel where one can have a royal stay with all modern comforts.

Acquiring an area up to 26 acres of land, the royal mansion is 110 ft high and showcases sumptuous rooms reflecting a rich bygone era. It is one among the most expensive hotels in Jodhpur. The regal palace constitutes of elegant royal heirlooms, high ceilings, marble corridors, treasure troves, hunting trophies, green velvet lawns and courtyards. The interiors of the palace were firstly designed by Maples of London in Art Deco style, but later, the ship carrying the stuff to Bombay was sunk by Germans in 1942. Afterwards, Maharaja Umed Singh himself bought a polished artist namely Stefan Norblin who was an interior decorator and was familiar with the style of Art deco.

The beautifully designed paintings and furnishings done by Stefan are still well-preserved here. It is the India’s last royal constructions. Moreover, out of total 26 acres of land, fifteen acres comprises of sprawling gardens, its central cupola, a ball room, a library, indoor swimming, billiards room, four tennis courts, 105 ft Darbar hall for audience, a marble pavilion, a nursery, garages that can park twenty motor cars and two marble squash courts.

Other than this, the grand mansion also comprises a unique clock tower, Durbar hall for public gathering, Edwardian drawing room, banquet, cinema hall, a private segment for ladies and billiards room. During its constructions, Umaid Bhawan was the most awaited palace for the’ Maharaos of Kotah’; as before they used to live in a small fort inside the same city. Thus, Umed Sigh decided to build this noble one to comfort the Maharao’s. 

Later, in 1930, the palace was extended by the architect George Devon, in order to provide space for Maharaj Kumar Bhim Singh and his wife. This section is still reserved and is not open for public, though, rest of the palace is considered to be the private residence as a heritage hotel. Similar to that of other royal Rajput mansions, Umaid Bhawan palace also has a Mardana section for male and a Zenana section for females with separate entrances. </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> The other name of the Umaid Bhawan Palace is the Chittar Palace, due to the fact that stones from the nearby Chittar Hill were used for its construction and were responsible for the golden yellow colour of the edifice.
Jodhpur Palace was voted as the World’s Best Hotel of 2016 at the Traveller’s Choice Award function which was organized by the travel website, TripAdvisor.
The palace was completed in 1943, tragic as may it seem but Maharaja U. Singh only stayed for four years in the palace as he died in 1947. </p>
