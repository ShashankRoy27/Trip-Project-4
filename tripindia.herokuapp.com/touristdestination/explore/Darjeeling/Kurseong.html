            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">     Kurseong – Hilly Town of White Orchid:
Walking along the steep hilly paths of Kurseong, enjoying the soothing gush of cool mountain breeze, which carries the mild fragrance of white orchids, you can’t help but be charmed by this bustling hill station. Its enthralling scenic beauty is enhanced by the lush tea gardens and the quaint colonial structures adorning the cityscape. Its name is derived from the Lepcha word ‘khorsang’ which translates as ‘the Land of White Orchids.’

Located in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal today, the city was initially a part of the kingdom of Sikkim before being conquered by Nepal in the 19th century. It was eventually captured and ruled by the British colonizers. Enriched by these historical influences and the local Lepcha residents, Kurseong boasts of a diverse and colorful culture.     </p>
