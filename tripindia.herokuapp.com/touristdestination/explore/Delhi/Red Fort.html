            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">    Red fort is one of the historic monuments located in Delhi. This monument gets its name from the red colored sandstone used for construction by the Mughals. This fort is located in the center of the city and was used as a ceremonial spot for the royals. Even today, the spot is used for political and national ceremonies.
Red fort is not just about the outer beauty of the fortified wall. You can find many interesting attractions inside the fort like palaces, halls, museums and others.

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">History of Red Fort</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">    The Qila-e-Mubarak or the blessed fort was home to Shah Jahan the Mughal Emperor and the grandson of Akbar, the greatest ruler the Mughal Empire ever saw. Not so different from Akbar, and having taken enough cues from him, Shah Jahan chartered his own course with élan. He was responsible for erecting some of the glorious structures of the time which are still identified as the most exquisite known for their sheer magnificence and the arduous journeys behind them. The Red Fort came to the being after Shah Jahan moved his capital from Agra and left his residence at the Agra Fort. He constructed a new walled city – Shahjahanbad naming it after himself and built a new residence, the Red Fort. It took a decade to complete the Red Fort which served as a residence to the Mughal rulers for nearly 200 years. The chief architect of the Red Fort was Ustad Ahmed Lahauri who started the construction in 1638 and completed in 1648.

The red in the Red Fort was always not present. What many don’t know is that the edifice was painted red by the British only after the limestone from which the building was originally built in started to chip off. The name Red Fort finds its roots in the British era after they painted it in red to preserve it and thus rechristened it to Red Fort which then had its translation to Lal Qila among the land of the people.
With the passing away of Shah Jahan the fate of the fort started to plummet as well. The successive rulers turned out to be defenceless against the rampages and pillages that followed. The Turk ruler Nadir Shah attacked the fort in 1739. The last Mughal ruler to have lived in the Red Fort was Bahadur Shah Zafar whose rule wasn’t so significant and the title was mere titular. Later when the British seized power and control, he was exiled to then Burma known as Myanmar now. And that was the end of the Mughal dynasty.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">    Delhi holds an international airport that connects several international destinations with Delhi. Delhi is connected with all states of the country via railways and roadways. Once you reach Delhi, you can find many modes of transportation to reach Red Fort. The fort is one of the important tourist destinations in the city.

The fort is located very close to Chandni Chowk metro state. If you get out of the Gate 5 from the metro station, you can hire rickshaw to reach the fort. You can also walk from the station to the destination. You can find taxis and autos from any part of the city to reach Red Fort.    </p>

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Architecture of Red Fort</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">    Standing proud on an area of 250 acres the Red Fort boasts of over 2 km of defensive walls adorned by bastions and turrets. The fort resembles an octagon and is decorated by marble, domes and flower engravings. Apparently the Kohinoor was part of the famous peacock throne.  The architectural, design and colour sensibilities of the fort set a rare specimen of the Mughal zeitgeist of the time. The Red Fort complex comprises the Red Fort and the Salimgarh Fort built in 1546 by Islam Shah Suri. The two gates of Red Fort: Lahori and Delhi Gates were built for the public whereas the Khizrabad Gate was what the emperor used. The Lahori Gate remains the main entrance to the Red Fort even today.
On entering the Diwan-i-‘Am, you will see the Naubat-Khana (Drum house). It is where the musicians played during ceremonial events. The huge hall has nine arches. The royal throne would be placed in the hall on the decorated alcove. Diwan-i-Khas is where the legendary peacock throne was said to be, before it was looted by Nadir Shah. The Red Fort also has Mumtaz Mahal which is now a museum, Rang Mahal, Khwabgah or the sleeping chambers, the Hammam or the royal bathing area with a garden without which any Mughal architecture is incomplete.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">    # Lal Qila is full of afternoon stories and its legends make for an interesting cosy chat. There is one which talks about how the prisoners were beheaded and used as a foundation of the building for good luck.
# There lies a hidden baoli or stepwell touted to be older than the Red Fort which remains inaccessible to visitors even today.
# It was said that one could fish from the fort back in the day when it was built on the western banks of the Yamuna but then the river changed its course over the years.
# The British destroyed the green belt inside the fortress to build barracks for the colonial army.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">    A site of protests, campaigns and political turbulence, Red fort was where the people marched in great number to show their solidarity for a nation they wished to call home. The fort has witnessed tears, sweat and blood during the Indian freedom struggle. The day after the iconic “Tryst with Destiny” speech delivered by Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the independent state addressed the vehement crowds at the Red Fort and raised the Indian flag – a symbol of the new found freedom ushering in an era of liberation, belonging and existence. An era, that was to see India becoming the biggest democracy in the world. And the tradition continues.
