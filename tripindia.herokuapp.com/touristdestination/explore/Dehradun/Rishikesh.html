            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">      Rishikesh has been a part of the legendary Kedarkhand (the present day Garhwal). Legends state that Lord Rama did penance here for killing Ravana, the demon king of Lanka; and Lakshmana, his younger brother, crossed the river Ganges, at a point, where the present Lakshman Jhula bridge stands today, using a jute rope bridge.

The Kedar Khand of Skanda Purana, also mentions the existence of Indrakund at this very point. The jute-rope bridge was replaced by iron-rope suspension bridge in 1889, and after it was washed away in the 1924 floods, it was replaced by a stronger present bridge.

The sacred river Ganges flows through Rishikesh. It is here that the river leaves the Shivalik mountains in the Himalayas and flows out into the plains of northern India. Several temples, ancient as well as new, can be found along the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh.      </p>

Rishikesh Orientation

The best way to go around Rishikesh is on foot as the town is hilly and consists of narrow lanes. To cross the river take a motor ferry from the iron suspension bridge known as Ram Jhoola, which is near Swargashram, or walk across either Ram Jhoola or Lakshman Jhoola, 2 km upstream. Practised riders take two-wheelers over them, disturbing what is otherwise a tranquil walk. Noisy tempos (called Vikrams or phatpatis) are affordable contraptions with amiable owners who have ‘arrangements’, so you might find yourself disembarking and getting on again en route, depending on the driver’s destination and the number of passengers left.       </p>
