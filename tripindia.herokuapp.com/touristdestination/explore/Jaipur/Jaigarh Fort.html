            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Located on the Hill of Eagles, Jaigarh fort was built in 1726 AD by Sawan Jai Singh II. Jaigarh Fort is located at a height of 500 feet above sea level and offers panoramic views of the surrounding. It houses the worlds largest cannon on the wheels called Jaivana Cannon. There are various other attractions within the fort like Laxmi Vilas, Lalit Mandir, Aram Mandir and the Vilas Mandir.
Jaigarh Fort is made-up of sandstones and is spread over an area of 3 km. Made with the purpose of protecting Amer Fort, Jaigarh fort is considered as the strongest monument of Jaipur. Also known by the name of Victory Fort, this place was considered as a storehouse of all the war amours, cannons, arms and ammunitions. There is a Persian style garden within the complex of the fort which is divided into 4 parts. The best part about the fort is its windows which are made of lattices. These windows allow a complete view of the exteriors, but nothing can be observed from the outside. </p>

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Jaigarh Fort: History </h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Jaigarh Fort was built to substantiate and add to the beauty of the popular Amer Fort, which is located nearby. For some time, it was also the residence for the royal family. The name of the fort is derived from the name of Sawai Jai Singh II, who played a key role in the history of this place.
Once upon a time, the fort served as a strategic and safe place for Rajput warriors as they could easily hide their arms, treasure and supplies here, without having to travel out of Amer repeatedly. The famous Jaivana cannon here was built around 1720 under the guidance of Jai Singh II.
Since Jaigarh Fort was built to safeguard Amer Fort, there is an underground route that connects these forts. It is an example of how intelligently the layout and construction was planned in those days. The Rajputs in Jaipur region at that time were the Kachhwahas, and they were allies of the Mughals, which is why they found the weapon and cannon store to be quite handy.The fort provides an excellent view of the Aravalli Range and Maota lake, and is actually built atop the Hill of Eagles, also known as Cheel ka Teela.
It was said to be the main cannon foundry for the Mughal rulers. The cannon outpost was protected during the many consecutive wars that broke out in the Mughal dynasty in 1658, until the protector Dara Shikoh was beaten in battle and slain by his own brother Aurangzeb.
During the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort came to be known as the world’s most efficient cannon foundry. It was mainly given this title because of the presence of massive iron ore mines located along the vicinity of the fort. The wind tunnel of the cannon foundry is said to suck in the hot air from outside and help in melting metal to build the cannons, with temperatures inside soaring as high as 2400 °F. </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Presently, this striking fort welcomes tourists from around the world. You can roam around the fort, admire its magnificent architecture and view the beautiful cannon and artilleries up close. Do not miss the Maota Lake, which is like a precious jewel on the crown of the fort. </p>

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Jaigarh Fort: Architecture </h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> The fort is constructed with red sandstone in the familiar Indo-Persian style, which remains a common trait in most of the forts in Jaipur. You will also notice the use of lime mortar in places. The famous structure, along with many other structures and monuments in the city, was designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, who was a renowned Bengali architect.
The outstanding feature of this fort is that the walls are massively thick and strong. This was done with the aim of making it hard to destroy. This is also the reason why it acted as a safe place of residence in case of an emergency.
Apart from exploring the fort, you can also include the beautiful Lalit Mandir, Vilas Mandir and Laxmi Vilas in your itinerary. The centuries-old Kal Bhairav and Harihar temples are a must-see too. There is a square garden in the centre, alongside a watchtower nearby. As Jaipur has always been a hot and humid place due to the deserts nearby, the forts here, including the Jaigarh Fort, were incorporated with rainwater harvesting techniques and underground water tanks.
There is also a central watchtower from where one can get a clear, unobstructed view of the stunning landscape on all sides. One of the most interesting features about the architecture of the fort is the lattice windows, which are so intricately designed that one can get a clear view of the outdoors from inside, but no one from outside can see the interiors through these windows.
The main entrance of the Jaigarh Fort is called the Dungar Darwaza. There are two ancient temples within the premises of the fort including the Ram Harihar Temple that was built in the 10th century and the Kal Bhairav Temple that has existed since the 12th century.
Guests can walk through courtrooms, restrooms, assembly halls and much more, which are a testimony to the brilliant architecture and construction techniques of the Rajputs. There are fortified gates throughout the fort that offer incredible views of the Aravalli ranges and Sagar Lake located in the vicinity of the fort. 
#Trivia: It houses the world’s biggest cannon on wheels known as ‘Jaivana’. </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> 
The Jaivana cannon was built on the premises of the Jaigarh Fort in 1720 by Jai Singh II. It was then the largest cannon in the whole world, with a total weight of 50 tonnes (50,000kg) and a length of 20.19 feet. Unlike traditional cannons which are mounted on two wheels, the Jaivana is mounted on 4 wheels.
This cannon can rotate 360 degrees and was originally made for intense warfare. However, because Shah Jahan (during whose time it was built) and the Rajputs were on friendly terms with each other, the cannon has only been fired once during its lifetime. It can still be found inside the Jaigarh Fort and is considered one of its primary attractions.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Do remember that Jaigarh Fort is not in Jaipur, but located on the outskirts of the Amer region, which was the real capital of the Rajputs here until Jaipur was built. The fort is about 10 km away from the main city. Because of the confusing routes, steep curves and hilly region, you should try and rent a private cab or one of the jeeps/buses that transports people from the main city to the Amer region throughout the day. If you plan to visit all three forts here together (Nahargarh Fort, Amer Fort, Jaigarh Fort), it might be wiser to hire a private cab as you wouldn’t have to look for an auto rickshaw or cab repeatedly.
In case you wish to travel by bus, the state government runs RSTC buses from main bus stops in Jaipur like Vaishali Nagar or Sanganer to Amer.
To reach Jaipur, you can easily travel via flight, train or road. It is extremely well connected with almost all regions of North and Central India because of its proximity to Delhi and since it is the capital of the largest state of India, Rajasthan. </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> 
Jaigarh Fort is one of the oldest forts in Jaipur with a rich history. Here are a few interesting facts you should know about the structure:

-Jaigarh Fort is made entirely of red sandstone that is composed of dressed stone that has been held together with lime mortar. 

-Even though it is famous in history as a store-house for battle paraphernalia, it started as a royal residence for the Rajas and Maharajas of Amer.

-The area around the fort was full of ore mines which resulted in Emperor Shah Jahan using it as one of his main cannon foundries.

-In fact, the Jaivana Cannon, which was then the largest cannon in the world and is now the largest moveable cannon in Asia can still be found on the premises of the Jaigarh Fort.

-The cannon weighs over 50 tonnes with a barrel that is 20.19 feet long and a diameter of 11 inches. It has been fired only once since its construction.

-One of the most attractive features of the fort is the central watchtower which was used by rules to keep an eye out for incoming invaders or attacks. It now serves as one of the most beautiful viewpoints in the Amer area, from where you can get an unparalleled view of the mountainside.

-The fort received a lot of media attention in 1977 when it was rumoured that a treasure left by the Kachwaha rulers still existed within the premises of the fort. The then Prime Minister of the country, India Gandhi, launched a treasure hunt when the Fort was closed for three days and officers from the Income Tax Department searched the Jaigarh Fort for the Kachwada treasure, but ultimately no treasure was found.

-It was later concluded that the treasure must have been utilized by Raja Jai Singh II built the city of Jaipur.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Here are some travellers’ tips to help you make the most of your trip to Jaigarh Fort. 
-Comfortable clothing is a must when you are visiting Rajasthan. Breathable fabrics like cotton and linen are recommended so that you don’t get too hot, even during the day. 
-You should carry a pair of climbing shoes and boots with you, in case the opportunity to explore the rough, hilly terrain arises. There are also a lot of sloping roads, so comfortable shoes should help you navigate the area better. 
-Unless you have an in-depth knowledge of the Jaigarh Fort, it is best to explore the area with a guide. There are long, winding passages and confusing corridors within the huge interiors, so it is very easy to get lost inside. 
-It is very important to stay hydrated in the Rajasthan heat, so carry water bottles with you at all times.
-Even though all parts of the fort are pretty much accessible, it is best to be careful around the edges of the terrace, doors and windows.
