            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  The Jal Mahal literally means the “Water Palace”, but when it was built, Maharaja Madho Singh I did not intend to use it as a palace. Instead, it was supposed to be a hunting lodge for the king and his entourage during their duck hunting trips. The palace stands in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city, and is a famous spot till date for sightseeing. The Jal Mahal is designed in a classic Rajput manner, with pink sandstone in a symmetrical style.  </p>

          <div class="col-lg-11 mb-4 mb-lg-0">
            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">The history of Jal Mahal</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  Though there is no official record of the exact period of origin of Jal Mahal, legend has it that it was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, whose idea behind building this palace was to use it as a hunting lodge for his duck shooting adventures and not as a palace to stay. The origin of the lake can also be attributed to him as it was formed when a dam was constructed between the hills which led to the formation of the lake.

Another legend says that it was built by Maharaja Madho Singh in the 1750s to serve as a hunting lodge. His son Madho Singh II had a big role to play in enhancing the interiors of Jal Mahal during the 18th century when he added the courtyard grounds which are still a part of this palace.

Jal Mahal and the lake around it were given a makeover by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amer in the eighteenth century. Later years saw the façade of this heritage site deprecating due to sewage and water logging and restoration work was undertaken again to bring the palace to its current glorious state. Though there are trees atop the terrace of the place, the garden hasn’t been made to look like it was in its days of glory, including the arched gateways which used to be there at the terrace. However, plans are underway to recreate a rooftop garden here on the likes of the one at Amer Palace in Jaipur.  </p>

      <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
        <div class="row justify-content-between align-items-lg-center">
          <div class="col-lg-11 mb-4 mb-lg-0">
            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Architecture of Jal Mahal</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  Jal Mahal was constructed right in the center of the Man Sagar Lake and though the place has five storeys, only one of the storeys is visible today, with the other four being submerged in water. The depth of this lake is 15 feet with its low lying areas having a depth of 4.9 feet.

This red sandstone palace reflects a mélange of the Rajput and Mughal architectural style and is symbolic of those times when these two reigns existed in India. The four corners of Jal Mahal are adorned with four octagonal domes or chhatris and a large rectangular one in Bengali style graces the terrace at its center.

People who have witnessed its beauty in its erstwhile glory talk about arched passageways on the terrace but it is a fact only heard in tales now. Even after braving two centuries, the palace still looks magnificent. People who visit the Nahargarh Fort can see Jal Mahal from there and are entranced by its beauty even from a distance.

Nahargarh hills that surround the lake from the north-east side have quartzite rock formations and covered with lush greenery all the year-round. An interesting trivia about the restoration work of this palace is that the work was done using traditional materials for plastering, materials that are not used in the construction work today. The plaster consists of partly organic material: a mortar mix of lime, surkhi, and sand mixed with gur (jaggery), guggal and methi (fenugreek) powder.  </p>

          <div class="col-lg-11 mb-4 mb-lg-0">
            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Things to do at Jal Mahal</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  Since a regular tourist is not allowed to visit Jal Mahal and the entry to the place was restricted for the public, it does not take more than an hour to see it from the banks of Sagar lake. During the days when the palace was open for tourist visits, gondolas ferried over the lake, carrying the tourists over to the palace, giving them a chance to enjoy a romantic ride over the lake

1. Photography: You can take some amazing pictures from the seating points at the side of the road, with the backdrop of the hills and the palace. At night when the place is lit up and its glittering silhouette is reflected in the dark water around Jal Mahal, it is a sight worth watching and capturing in your memory and camera.
During the monsoons, when the sky is heavily overcast, the verdant hills behind Jal Mahal present a picturesque setting and that is why it is probably one of the most photographed sights in Jaipur.

2. Savor the moment: The boundary wall between the lake and the road is lined with seating areas where tourists can sit and enjoy the view of the lake and the palace. Though the place sees a lot of tourists, if you find yourself a good spot you can spend some time here.

3. Street shopping: On the footpath adjoining the boundary wall, you will find several hawkers selling traditional Rajasthani jewellery, mojris which are traditional kind of shoes and handicraft items. You can surely put your bargaining skills to test here and the hawkers will oblige you.

4. Camel rides: You will find several photographers here, ready to take your instant picture in traditional attire and you can even take camel rides. You might also spot a stall or two selling packed refreshments.

5. Bird watching: The salubrious hills covered with lush green trees and the lake gets a lot of migratory avian visitors. You can spend a lot of time admiring the mesmerizing beauty of the place at sunset and doing some bird watching. In its glorious days and when the water of the lake was way cleaner than it is now, Jal Mahal was home to various migratory birds like great crested grebe, flamingos, pintail, kestrel, and pilchards, etc. With pollution making the water of lake unsuitable for them, gradually they stopped coming altogether.

After the restoration work was undertaken at the palace and its surrounding areas, a few birds can now be seen at Man Sagar Lake like the grey heron, common moorhen, blue-tailed bee-eaters and white-browed wagtail. The authorities now even organize an annual bird fair to spread awareness about the lakes condition and to urge tourists and the local visiting population to keep it clean.

6. Statues near Jal Mahal: A little distance from Jal Mahal and towards the side of the road there is another beautiful sight to witness. It is a scenery or a tableau depicting a procession in place, with the sculpture of a king on an elephant leading the group and being followed by dancers and musicians. These bronze statues reflect the glory of the days of the Maharajas in the city.  </p>
