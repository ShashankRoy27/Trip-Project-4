            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Nahargarh Fort sits proudly on a ridge of the Aravalli Hills, creating an impressive northern backdrop to the city of Jaipur. It was constructed during the reign of Jai Singh in 1734, and was later expanded in 1868. Nahargarh, which means abode of tigers, was a formidable barrier, defending Jaipur against attacking enemies. Within its walls, the fort houses Madhavendra Bhawan, the summer destination for the members of the royal family. Built by Sawai Madho Singh, the palace has 12 matching boudoirs for the queens, at the head of which is a suite for the king. They are all connected by corridors decorated with delicate murals. Even today the palace is a favoured spot for local picnickers. The fort looks brilliant when floodlit at night. Overlooking the city, it presents a glittering view of the city lights.Nahargarh means ‘abode of tigers’ and was named so after the tigers which were believed to have roamed around the hills. It is also believed that the fort was named after Prince Nahar Singh Bhomia.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Nahargarh Fort was built in 1734 by the then Maharaja of Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh II. He constructed the fort as a retreat for the hunting expeditions of the royal family. The fort was initially named Sudarshangarh but was later renamed as Nahargarh. According to local legends, the construction of the fort was obstructed by the spirit of a Rathore prince named Nahar Singh Bhomia. To pacify the spirit, a temple was built in his memory within the premises and the fort was renamed to honor him. 

The massive fortification walls of this fort extended to reach up to the Jaigarh Fort, which formed a wall of defence around the city of Jaipur. Throughout its history, this fort never faced any attack. However, it has remained witness to several significant events in the past that took place within its premises, including the signing of truces with the Maratha armies in the 18th century. During India’s first rebellion for freedom in 1857, the king of Jaipur had relocated the Europeans living in that region within the walls of the fort.

In 1868, the fort was renovated and extended by Sawai Ram Singh, the then king of Jaipur. During the period from 1883 to 1892, several palaces were added to the fort at a huge cost of around 3, 50,000 rupees. Separate suites were built within the fort for the royal women and the king. Till 1944, the Jaipur State Government used to fire a gunshot from this fort as a time signal for the whole city. </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Nahargarh Fort, one of the top tourist places to visit in Jaipur, is designed in the Indo-European style of architecture. The fort features an imposing entrance, called Tadigate, and houses several impressive structures within its premises. There are a couple of temples inside the fort complex, including the one dedicated to Nahar Singh Bhomia and another one dedicated to the rulers of Jaipur. The undulating walls of the fort are extended over several kilometers.

Madhavendra Bhawan aka Madhavendra Palace is the most attractive structure within the fort. Constructed by Sawai Madho Singh, this two-storied palace compound comprises of separate living quarters for the king and his queens. There are nine identical suites built for each of the nine queens, each of which is adorned with bedrooms, lobby, kitchen, and other essential sections. All these suites were connected through corridors adorned with stunning frescos, but they were built in such a manner that the king could visit any one of his queens without the knowledge of the other queens. The building also includes a large open-air enclosure called Diwan-i-Aam, where the king held audience with his subjects and attended to their grievances.

There are also two step wells at Nahargarh Fort, one located within it and one within the ramparts. Of these, the biggest is the one outside the fort and it has also been featured in Bollywood movies. A distinguishing feature of these wells is that unlike most other step wells in India, they feature an asymmetrical design. This is primarily because these wells are constructed without altering the natural terrain of the mountains. </p>
