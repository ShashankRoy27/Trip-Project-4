            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Regarded as a highly sacred pilgrimage with great historical significance, the Galta Ji Temple lies 10 kilometres to the east of Jaipur city. The temple complex is basically a cluster of several temples, Galta Ji being the main temple. The temples are built within a narrow crevice of a mountain pass in the Aravalli hills.

The temple complex has several sacred tanks that are locally called Kunds and are used by pilgrims for bathing and thereby washing away their sins. The kunds are filled by the means of a natural spring that emerges high on the hills and makes its way downward, filling all seven sacred kunds. The Galta Kund is considered to be the holiest of all kunds here, and also holds great significance as it is believed to have never dried up till date. </p>

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">History Of Galtaji Temple</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> The Galta Ji Temple was built by Diwan Rao Kriparam, who was an attendant at the court of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. The temple complex was built in the 18th Century. Even before the temple was built, the place still used to be of utmost importance to the Vaishavites Ramanandis.

Many historians have added to the history of Galta Ji stating that way before the 16th Century, many yogis and sadhus (saints) lived here at the site where Galta Ji Temple stands today. The yogis and saints were driven away by the mystical and spiritual powers of a Ramanandi Sadhu by the name Krishnadas Payo Hari.

It is said that the Ramanandi Sadhu lived only on a ‘milk only diet’ and was called ‘Payo Bhaksha’ due to which, the word ‘Payo’ was added to his name. As time went by, the site became a centre of significant importance for both Ramanandi Hindus and Naga Sadhus. They are also believed to have taken part in many wars.

About the Ramanandis: In medieval India, Saint Ramananda was a follower of the Ramanujacharya sect of Vaishnavism (Hinduism). The Ramnandis consider themselves to be the descendants of Luv and Kush, the sons of Lord Rama.

When it comes to composing history and poems, Guru Nabha Dass Ji had composed his famously disputed poem ‘Bhaktamal’ while he was living at Galta Ji. The composition of the poem is largely based on the account of Bhaktas across sectarian paths and hence, is considered important source for the history of Northern India. It is a part of the literary and devotional history of North India.

Another important historical aspect of Galta Ji is that the founding philosophy of the ‘International ISKCON Movement’ started by Swami Prabhupada, was borrowed from ‘Govind Bhashya’ written by Swami Baldeo Vidyabhusan in Galta Ji. The Govind Bhashya is a commentary on Vedanta Sutra and was written in 1718 AD.

Additionally, the most secular Mughal Emperor, Akbar had also visited Galta Ji to seek blessings thereby donating 2592 bighas of land to the head of Galta Ji soon after his wishes were answered. This grant is a historical document that is still preserved at Galta Peeth.

Apart from these, another interesting historical fact is that there were many small temples built around the hills that surround the Galta Ji Temple even before the Galta Ji temples were built. These temples today are in ruins but one can still sense the opulence even in their ruins.

The Galta Temples were submerged in water during the floods in Jaipur in 1981. However, the swift restoration work got the temples back to their glory very soon. </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> The Galta temple is mostly admired for its natural water springs wherein the water rushes out automatically in the temple complex and gets stored in the tanks. The specialty of this place is that the natural spring over here never dries out which surprises the visitors and persuades them from all around. There are a total of seven tanks in this temple complex and out of that, Galta Kund is the most sacred one. It is considered as optimistic to take a bath in this sacred kund during the festival of Makar Sankranti in the month of January. </p>

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Architecture of Galtaji Temple</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> The architecture of the Galta Ji is typical to a mix of Indian classical and Rajasthani elements as there are beautiful frescoes to Indian mythology paintings along with the canopies or the curvilinear chhatris adorning the roofs of the temples. The windows are designed in typical Rajasthani architecture.

The entire temple is built of pink sandstone having pavilions with intricately carved pillars and painted ceilings and walls. The paintings on the ceilings and walls of the temples mostly depict stories from Hinduism and Indian mythology.

Out of all the temples in the Galta Ji complex, Shri Gyan Gopal Ji temple &amp; Shri Sitaram Ji temple are constructed in haveli style. The Shri Sitaram Ji Temple is the biggest among all temples at Galta Ji. As per people’s belief, the idol of Shri Ram Gopal Ji at the Sitaram Ji Temple looks like both Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. The legend behind the idol being similar to both Lord Rama and Lord Krishna is that Lord Krishna appeared before Tulsidas in the form of Lord Rama and Tulsidas described what he saw. Hence, the semblance.

The Hanuman temple in the complex is famous for its ‘Akahnd Jyoti’ (the eternal lamp), the flame of which has been burning for centuries, since the time the Hanuman idol was consecrated. Many people find this belief a little out of the horizon of belief but there are people who still believe in such legends.

The Shri Gyan Gopal Ji Temple compound houses a school for students and disciples. There is a pretty idol of Lord Krishna inside the Gyan Gopal ji Temple. There are several small temples inside the Galta Ji complex that stretch from the Galta Gate to Shri Sitaram Ji Temple. </p>
