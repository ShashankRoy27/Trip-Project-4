            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  Jantar Mantar is one of the oldest astronomical observatories featuring the world’s largest stone sundial, located in the heart of Jaipur. It is no longer a working science center but is maintained as a monument, and education activity sessions, guided tours and music and light shows, are organized here. Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is one of the largest observatories in the world, comprising of remarkable stone assemblies that help to interpret the position of celestial bodies and calculate local time. Enumerated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, Jantar Mantar attracts tourists, historians, astronomers, architects, mathematicians, and geographers. The collection of nineteen astronomical instruments in Jantar Mantar allows the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The monument is an exemplification of architectural innovations that was built on ideas from different religious and social beliefs in 18th-century India.  </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  Jantar Mantar, Jaipur was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, and he built 5 such observatories in different parts of the country: Jaipur, Mathura, Delhi, Ujjain, and Varanasi. The one in Jaipur is the largest of all, whereas the one in Mathura is almost in ruins, now. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II is the founder of Jaipur city and a potential ruler of Amber region. Along with his political expertise, he was also a scholar in physics, mathematics, and astronomy. During his reign, he was commissioned by Emperor Muhammad Shah to rectify astronomical calculations in Islamic zij tables. To accomplish this task, he gathered astronomical data from European and Persian nations and studied and interpreted the same.

After extensive research and studying the gathered data, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II constructed stone made instruments to determine the position of planetary bodies and measure time. Jaipur Jantar Mantar was built between 1728-1734 and its stone instruments are considered to be more accurate than others.  </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  The monument is an imposing collection of nineteen astronomical instruments, constructed out of local stone and marble, and spread over about 18,700 square metres. Each of these astronomical instruments carries an astronomical scale, generally marked on the marble inner lining. Bronze tablets, bricks and mortar, were also used in the construction of these instruments. This stone observatory includes complex instruments whose settings and shapes are scientifically designed, illustrating the glorious past of Medieval Indian astronomy. Jantar Mantar features the worlds largest stone sundial - Vrihat Smarat Yantra.  </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">  The Jantar Mantar is an observatory comprising of 19 instruments to measure the position and distances of celestial bodies. These 19 instruments are structures carved out of stone, depicting interesting geometric shapes.
Popular structures inside the monument-

Vrihat Smarat Yantra
Vrihat Smarat Yantra is a huge sun dial at the centre of Jantar Mantar observatory. This 27m long structure is the tallest sundial in the world. ‘Samrat Yantra’ meaning ‘supreme instrument’ is an equinoctial sundial and calculates time up to the accuracy of two seconds.

Laghu Smarat Yantra
Popularly known as the small Smarat Yantra, this instrument is smaller in size, and measures the local time up to the accuracy of twenty seconds. The ramp of this sundial points towards the North Pole, so the local time in Jaipur can be easily calculated by measuring the position of ramp’s shadow on the divisions of the carved scale.

Ram Yantra
Ram Yantra measures the elevation and azimuth of Sun and planets, and consists of a pair of tube- shaped structures, open to the sky. Each tube-shaped structure has a pole of equal height at the centre. Scales indicating angles of altitude and azimuth of the celestial bodies are inscribed inside the walls of these structures. Ram Yantra is only found in Jantar Mantar of Jaipur and New Delhi.

Jaya Prakash Yantra
This yantra includes two hemispherical bowls like sundials with graded marble slabs. The elevation, azimuth, hour angles and exact position of heavenly bodies are detected using the inverted image of the sky, and the movement of the inverted shadows on the slabs.

Chakra Yantra
The chakra yantra as the name suggests is a ring instrument that measures the co-ordinates and the hour angle of Sun.

Digamsa
Digamsa is a pillar-like structure in the middle of two concentric outer circles, which is used to predict the sunrise and sunset timings in a day.

Nadivalaya
Consisting of a pair of circular plates, facing north and south, Nadivalaya symbolizes the two hemispheres of Earth.

Karnti Vritya
Karnti Vritya is a special instrument used to measure the solar sign of the Sun in daytime.  </p>
