            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Shri Amarchand Badwa, who served as the Prime minister of Mewar kingdom during the reign of Maharanas Pratap Singh II, Raj Singh II, Ari Singh, and Hamir Singh from the period of 1751 to 1778, built Bagore Ki Haveli. Following the death of Amarchand Badwa, the haveli came under the possession of Mewar royal family and became the abode of Nath Singh, a relative of the then Maharana.

In 1878, Maharaj Shakti Singh of Bagore further extended the haveli by building the triple-arched gateway and since then it is known as Bagore ki Haveli. Till 1947, the haveli remained in the possession of Mewar state.Post India’s Independence, the Haveli was used by the Rajasthan government for housing government employees. The haveli was neglected for almost forty years and later in 1986, the Government eventually decided to handover the restoration work to the West Zone Cultural Centre.

This hour long show takes place in the courtyard called as the Neem Chowk. The beautifully lit up balconies of the Neem chowk add charm to the Haveli setting up a stage for the traditional Rajasthani folk dance and music.

Seating arrangements are made on the floor around the stage. The floor is arranged with large mattresses placed around the three sides of the terrace to get a good view of the dance performances.The Dharohar Dance Show is very well organized starting with a brief introduction given by a Rajasthani woman dressed in a traditional Rajasthani attire. The performances are preceded by the beating of a drum, blowing of a conch shell and a religious song.

The show consists of well choreographed dances ably supported by the musicians playing tabla and harmonium. The women performing the dance wear typical Rajasthani folk costumes with colorful ghagra cholis embodied with glass work and embroidery work.

The first dance performance is called Chari Dance where the performers dance with lit brass pots on their head skillfully balancing them.

The next dance performance called as Terha Taal Dance needs perfect coordination skills as the dancers play 13 manjiras (bells) tied to their hands and legs according to the rhythm of the music. At one point of time in the performance they hold a knife in their mouth along with a set of brass pots on their head as well as play manjiras, all at the same time quite skillfully.

The Gorbandh Dance is the next performance where the dancers perform wearing ornaments used to adorn camels and dance in complete abandon. Women twirling in high speed while holding hands, this performance is sure to remind one of their childhood days.

Taking a detour from the dance performances, the next one is Rajasthani Puppet show which caters to young kids in the audience. The comical skits performed with the puppets add humour to the show.

Next in the line of performances is the high class dance performance known as Ghumar Dance where the dancers dance in rhythmic circles according to the music accompanying it.

The final performance of the show is called Bhavani dance where performer dances with earthen pots on her head. This performance is the most difficult ones as the performer dances with two pots to upto 13 pots on her head while performing various acts including standing on a broken glass.

The Dharohar dance show at the Bagore-ki-Haveli is a colorful and vibrant show that showcases tradition and culture of the Rajasthani folklore in an interesting manner. The skills and artistry of the performers are definitely worth admiring and should not be missed by anyone visiting this beautiful Haveli. </p>
