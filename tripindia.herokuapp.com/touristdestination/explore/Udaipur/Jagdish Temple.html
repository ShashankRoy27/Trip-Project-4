            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Jagdish temple is one of the best architectural wonders of the Mewar dynasty. Jagdish temple showcases the Indo- Aryan architectural style. The temple is built keeping the rules of Vastushastra, the Hindu architectural science in mind.

This three-storied temple is built on raised platform flaunting magnificently carved pillars, huge airy halls and painted walls that are adorned with vibrant colors and intricately decorated ceilings. At the entrance, there are two massive elephants statues of stone, installed to welcome the visitors. An inscription engraved on the stone slab is found at the entry. Mahara Jagat Singh installed the inscription to record his contributions to the temple.
The main temple is 79 feet high, and it prominently controls the city’s skyline. The summit of the main temple is adorned with the statues of horsemen, elephants, musicians, and dancers who were practicing during the time when temple was established. The main temple is 32 steps away from the entrance. Here you get to see a brass image of Garuda, a half man, and half eagle figure. Garuda has a noteworthy significance in the Hindu religion,, as it is considered that Garuda guards the gates of Lord Vishnu’s house.

The next idol found in the main shrine is a four-armed image of Lord Vishu, which is considered as one of the most striking features of Jagdish temple. The statue of God Jagannath is a treat to watch since it is carved out from one piece of black stone, making it a marvelous piece of art and devotion. It is believed that the statue of Lord Vishnu tends to have a hypnotic effect on the devotees and bring a sense of calmness and serenity.

As said, God is a peacemaker, so whenever in doubt go to him, and he will help you out. People from all around the world visit Jagdish temple to get answers to their problems. The main temple is surrounded by small shrines of other God and Goddesses. The temples belong to Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva, Sun Goad, and Goddess Shakti.

The first two floors of the building have 50 pillars each. Each pillar has intricate carvings making it an astonishing sight. The mandap (prayer hall), a porch and a pyramidal spire add to the beauty of the temple.

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">History</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">The temple was built in 1651 under the reign of Maharana Jagat Singh who ruled Udaipur from 1628 to 1653. Jagdish Temple is the home of Lord Vishnu and an iconic example of Maru-Gujaru architecture of the era. The Maharana Jagat Singh spent 1.5 million rupees to enhance the structure of the Jagdish temple. The temple was renovated due to Mughal invasion.

The Mughal invaders have destroyed many figurines and carvings in the temple as a part of revenge upon Rajput rulers. The Mughals took to vandalism to take out their anger and frustrations on their defeat by the hands of Mewar rulers.

According to the old legends, it is believed that the marble slab in the Jagdish temple has magical powers. If you rub your shoulder, knees, or back on the marble, you can get a quick relief against the pain. For some people, it might be hard to believe, but the beliefs associated with religion cannot be questioned.</p>
