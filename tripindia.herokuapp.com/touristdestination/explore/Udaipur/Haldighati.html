            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Haldighati is a famed mountain pass in the hills of the Aravalli Range. The pass, about 40 kilometres from Udaipur, connects the districts of Rajsamand and Pali. The pass gets its name from the yellow-coloured soil of the region (turmeric is called haldi in Hindi). The mountain pass has gone down the annals of history as the site where the Battle of Haldighati was fought in 1576 between Rana Pratap Singh of Mewar and Raja Man Singh of Amber who was the general of the Mughal emperor Akbar. The site of the battle lies at the south-west side of Nathdwara. Maharana Pratap fought a brave war, but his loyal horse, Chetak, gave up his life as the Maharana was leaving the battlefield. In 1997, the Government of India proposed and constructed the Maharana Pratap National Memorial, and it is today dedicated to the spirit and valour of the Rajput King. The memorial, a cenotaph with white marble columns, displays a bronze statue of the Maharana riding Chetak. Besides the battle, Haldighati is known around the world for its charity rose products and mud art of Molela.</p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Situated in the Aravalli range, the historic site of Haldighati is 40 km away from the central Udaipur city near the Rakt Talai on the Maharana Pratap Stadium Road. The Haldighati region is situated in the Aravalli mountain range which links the Pali and Rajasamad districts in Rajasthan.One can hire a taxi or rent a car to go to Haldighati from Udaipur.</p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Haldighati is a unique historic mountain pass located in the Aravalli Mountain range. Haldighati derived its name from the term ‘Haldi’ means turmeric in English, used as a spice in Indian delicacies and ‘Ghati’ means valley which together makes the name Haldighati. The soil found in this region of Udaipur is yellow in color, hence the place is named Haldighati.

There is a cenotaph called chhatri in Hindi built on the place where the horse of Maharana Pratap, Chetak breathed his last. This cenotaph is located at a close distance of 4 Km from the Haldighati in pure white marble to pay respect and admire the contribution of the fastest horse in Indian history.

You can find Balicha village located close to the region known for its unique knowledge of arts and crafts via terracotta. There is a stunning garden in the name of Badshahi Bagh. The presence of ‘Chaitri-Gulab, original and authentic rose water, and ‘Gulkand’ (jam made from rose petals) is unique to this garden. The rose water is of great medicinal importance.In the proximity, you can find the Maharana Pratap National Memorial, built in the year 1997 under the commission of Government of India. The memorial showcases an extraordinary statue of Maharana Pratap riding his horse made of bronze metal. You can also locate a museum in the name of Maharana Pratap. The doors of the museum were opened for the public in the year 2003.</p>

            <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">History</h2>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Known for the bloodiest battle fought in the region, the Battle of Haldighati has an essential place in history. If you have a slight bent towards Indian history, you will know that the Indian history is incomplete without reference to the Battle of Haldighati.

This historic Battle of Haldighati has been fought on 21st June 1576 between Maharana Pratap, the Mewar King, and Emperor Akbar, a Mughal ruler. Even though it is one of the most significant battles in Rajput history, it was also the shortest battle ever fought in the past.

This ferocious fight fought on this narrow strip of mountains lasted for 4 hours, only leading to mass-scale death of the heroic soldiers of the time. The blood could be found all over the place, making it turned red instead of yellow in this case.

Sadly Maharana Pratap lost the battle to Raja Man Singh of Amber, one of the most trusted army generals of Mughals during the times.
Haldighati is also significant for another reason, i.e., the unexplainable companionship of Maharana Pratap and his horse, Chetak. Chetak, the loyal companion of Pratap, took his last breath just a few kilometers away, only after leaving Pratap to a safe place.

Haldighati is considered to be the pride of the Rajsamand district of Udaipur. The stellar role of Haldighati and its indifferent aura reminds us of the sacrifices made by the gallant warriors to protect the honor of the Rajputana kingdom. The place also sends chills down the spine as it speaks of the merciless killings and selfless acts of soldiers made to protect India from the clutches of brutal foreign forces.
