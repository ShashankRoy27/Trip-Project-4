            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">   The artificial Lake Pichola was built by Pichhu Banjara, a gipsy tribesman who transported grain, during the rule of Maharana Lakha in 1362 AD. The meaning of the word Pichola is the backyard and the lake was named after a nearby village Picholi. Maharana Udai Singh was enchanted by the beauty of this lake that he constructed Udaipur on the banks of the lake.

The lakes surroundings have palaces, marble temples, family mansions, bathing ghats or chabutaras which were built over the centuries. Some of the renowned are the Lake Palace or Jag Nivas, Mohan Mandir and the Jag Mandir Palace. The Jag Nivas has now been converted into a heritage hotel and is located on the Jag Island. The Mohan Mandir is located in the north-east corner of the lake was built by Jagat Singh between 1628 and 1652. There is also a Arsi Vilas Island which was built by one of the Maharajas of Udaipur to enjoy the sunset on the lake. It is also a sanctuary for different varieties of birds. At several locations where the lake narrows, ornamental arch bridges have been built to span the waterway between the banks. With dimensions of 3 miles in length, 2 miles in width and a depth of 30 feet, Lake Pichola has four main islands namely Jag Niwas, Jag Mandir, Mohan Mandir and Arsi Vilas.   </p>

The subsequent generations including Udai Singh II added impressive structures to the palace complex.

9. Chabutaras: Raised platforms can also be seen along the banks of Lake Pichola used for various purposes mostly within a courtyard. One such platform is Natini Chabutara that has an interesting legend associated with it.
Natini, a tightrope walker who used to live during the reign of Maharana Jawan Singh (1828–38) was asked by the drunkard king to cross the lake on a tightrope from a village on the west bank of the lake to the City Palace on the east bank. He promised to gift her half of the Mewar kingdom if she would successfully cross the lake.
It is believed that the king cut off the rope before she could reach the end of the rope and Natini fell into the lake. Cheated by the king, she cursed him that his family would not have any direct descendents or heirs from then on. This curse is believed to have come true as six Ranas out of the seven succeeding Jawan Singh were adopted.
