            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">       Built on the banks of Lake Pichola, the City Palace in Udaipur is considered to be the largest royal complex in Rajasthan. The magnificent palace was built in the year 1559 by Maharana Uday Singh and served as the main seat of power, where the Maharanas lived and administered the kingdom from. Subsequently, the palace was made even more splendid by his successors, who added a number of structures to it. The Palace now has an assortment of Mahals, courtyards, pavilions, corridors, terraces, rooms and hanging gardens. There is a museum here as well that showcases some of the finest elements of Rajput arts and culture - from colourful paintings to the typical architecture found in Rajasthani palaces.       </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">       The History of City Palace is related to the kingdom of Mewar that has gone through several capital changes during the reign of its many rulers. The capital was first established in Nagda in 568 AD by Guhil, the first Maharana of Mewar. It was later moved to Chittor in the 8th century under the rule of Sisodias.

During 1537, the Mewar kingdom came under the rule of Maharana Udai Singh II. Due to war with the Mughals there was a risk of losing the Chittor fort. Hence, Maharana Udai Singh II chose a new capital for his kingdom near Lake Pichola that shielded the territory from its enemies, well surrounded by forests, lakes and the imposing Aravalli hills.
The construction of City Palace started under the reign of Maharana Udai Singh II and was enhanced subsequently by his successors over a period of 400 years. This palace is of great historical importance as it served as the administrative complex of the Maharanas.

The first royal structure that was built in the City palace complex was Rai Angan, the royal courtyard. After the death of Maharana Udai Singh II, his son Maharana Pratap took over Udaipur. During the Battle of Haldighati, Maharana Pratap lost the war to the Mughal emperor Akbar and Udaipur came under the rule of the Mughals.

After Akbar’s death, Mewar was handed over to Maharana Prataps son and successor Amar Singh I by the Mughal ruler Jahangir. Udaipur once again fell into the attacks of Marathas in the year 1761. To protect Mewar from further attacks, Maharana Bhim Singh signed a treaty with the British in 1818 asking for their protection. After India’s independence, Mewar became a part of democratic India in 1949 and kings of Mewar retained the ownership of the palaces in Udaipur.

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">       Built in granite and marble, City Palace complex is worth admiring for its perfect blend of Medieval, European and Chinese architecture. The several palaces in the complex stand magnificently behind the 100ft high and 801 ft long facade built exquisitely on the ridge of Lake Pichola.

Located at an elevation of 1,962 ft, the City Palace complex was built by the 22 generations of Sisodia Rajputs over an extensive period of time starting from the year of 1559. Udai Singh II and several other Maharanas have contributed significantly for the construction of this impressive complex. The complex comprises of 11 small palaces and other structures built homogeneously in its design.
The interiors of the palace complex are as commendable as its exteriors. The intricate mirror-work, marble-work, murals, wall paintings, silver-work, inlay-work and colored glass that adorn the balconies, towers and cupolas of the complex are worth admiring.

The terraces in the upper part of the complex offer a breathtaking view of the lake and the surrounding Udaipur city. The palaces in the complex are connected by chowks and the corridors in the palace are built in zigzag manner to evade any surprise attacks from enemies.

The City Palace complex is enriched with many structures that can be reached through the main Tripolia (triple) gate which acts as the entry point to the complex.

Other structures within the complex are the Suraj Gokhda (public address facade), Mor-chowk (Peacock courtyard), Dilkhush Mahal (heart’s delight), Surya Chopar, Sheesh Mahal (Palace of glass and mirrors), Moti Mahal (Palace of Pearls), Krishna Vilas, Shambhu Niwas, Bhim Vilas, Amar Vilas (with a raised garden), Badi Mahal (the big palace), Fateh Prakash Palace and the Shiv Niwas Palace.

The complex also has facilities of a post office, bank and travel agency. There are a number of craft shops and an Indian boutique supported by World Wildlife Fund(WWF) that the tourists can visit on their trip to the palace complex.

The Mewar royal family owns the entire Palace complex and the structures in the complex are maintained by various trusts. The Fateh Prakash Palace and the Shiv Niwas Palace are now transformed into heritage hotels.       </p>

            <p style="font-family:Times New Roman">       The palace is a conglomeration of a number of different structures. They are as follows:-

1. Gateways: The palace has a number of entrances, starting with the Bari Pol towards the left, Tripolia, which is a triple arched gate built in 1725, to the centre and Hathi Pol to the right. The main entrance to the palace is through the Bara Pol which welcomes you into the first courtyard. This is the place where the Maharanas used to be weighed with gold and silver and the jewels were distributed among the poor. Marble arches have been constructed here as well, and is called the Toran Pol. 
2. Amar Vilas: The Amar Vilas is an elevated garden area which has a wonderful hanging garden richly decorated with fountains, towers, terraces and a square marble tub.

3. Badi Mahal: Also known as the Garden Palace, this edifice is propped on a natural rock formation which is 27 metres high. A swimming pool is also situated here which was used during the celebration of Holi. A hall here houses miniature paintings of 18th and 19th centuries, wall paintings of Jag Mandir and Vishnu of Jagdish temple.
4. Fateprakash Palace: The Fateprakash palace has now been converted into a hotel. Rare items such as crystal chairs, dressing tables, sofas, tables, chairs and beds, crockery, table fountains and jewel studded carpet are present here. Incidentally, these have never been used as Maharana Sajjan Singh had ordered these rare items in 1877 but he died before they arrived here.
5. Durbar hall: The Darbar Hall is a relatively newer addition and was built in 1909 as a venue for official functions in the Fateprakash Palace itself. The hall is embellished with scintillating chandeliers and has a display of Maharana portraits and weapons

At the upper level, there is a projecting balcony, which is flanked by inserts of coloured glass. Adjacent to this chamber is the Kanch-ki-Burj, which has a collection of mirror mosaics adorning the walls. The Badi Charur Chowk within this chowk is a smaller court for private use.
